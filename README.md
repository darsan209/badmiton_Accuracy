The project focuses on analyzing badminton shots to evaluate accuracy and performance using computer vision and machine learning.

By processing video footage, the system can detect shuttlecock trajectories and determine whether shots land inside or outside the court boundaries.

The model helps players track their improvement and identify weak areas in gameplay.

It combines image processing, object detection, and classification techniques to provide real-time feedback.
